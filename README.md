üéÆ Tic Tac Toe - Modern UI & CLI
A polished Tic Tac Toe game built using both Web Technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and Java (OOP CLI) ‚Äî showcasing front-end design, JavaScript logic, and object-oriented programming in Java.
This project demonstrates clean UI design, event-driven programming, and modular code structure.

‚ú® Features
‚úÖ Web Version (Modern UI)
Clean, minimalist design with glassmorphism effect.

Responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

Interactive cells with smooth hover and click animations.

Real-time status update for player turns.

Win/draw detection logic.

Restart button for replaying the game.

üñ•Ô∏è Java CLI Version
Fully interactive terminal-based game.

Robust input handling using Scanner and exception management.

Dynamic board rendering after each move.

OOP structure using TicTacToeGame and Board classes.

Win and draw detection using encapsulated logic.

üß† Concepts Demonstrated
In Frontend:
DOM Manipulation using vanilla JavaScript.

Event-driven programming (addEventListener, click).

Responsive UI design with CSS Grid.

Transition and animation for enhanced UX.

MVC-like logic separation for UI and game logic.

In Java:
Encapsulation: Board logic is separated in its own class.

Abstraction: Game logic is abstracted into clean methods.

Exception Handling: Gracefully handles invalid inputs.

Reusability: Methods are modular and easy to extend (e.g., AI, multiplayer).

Clean Code: Proper naming conventions and comments.

üîÑ How to Run
Web Version:
Clone the repository or download index.html.

Open the file in any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Start playing!

üìà Future Improvements
Add AI opponent using Minimax algorithm.

Track scores across multiple rounds.

Create React version with better state management.

Implement multiplayer over local network.
